# Renderer 3D
Simple 3d engine, uses SDL 2.0 but only to create window and present final bitmap. Engine perform rasterization. Basic mesh operations like translation, rotation are supported. Engine implements basic algorithms 
like z-buffering, Gouraud shading, linear interpolation. User can use
keyes to manipulate camera. Allows loading meshes from obj file but its scale must be normalized.
